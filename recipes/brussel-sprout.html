    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This recipe is from my mother. It may sound strange, but these are really good and very easy to make. The Brussels sprouts should be brown with a bit of black on the outside when done. Any leftovers can be reheated or even just eaten cold from the fridge. I don't know how, but they taste sweet and salty at the same time!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1½ pounds Brussels sprouts, ends trimmed and yellow leaves removed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place trimmed Brussels sprouts, olive oil, kosher salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal tightly, and shake to coat. Pour onto a baking sheet, and place on center oven rack.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, shaking pan every 5 to 7 minutes for even browning. Reduce heat when necessary to prevent burning. Brussels sprouts should be darkest brown, almost black, when done. Adjust seasoning with kosher salt, if necessary. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
